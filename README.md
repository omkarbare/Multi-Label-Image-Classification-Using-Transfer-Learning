## Dog Breed Identification using Transfer Learning with a Custom Convolutional Neural Network
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for identifying the breed of dogs using transfer learning with a custom convolutional neural network. The model is trained on a large dataset of dog images, and can accurately predict the breed of a given dog image with high accuracy.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Stanford Dogs Dataset which contains 20,580 images of dogs from 120 different breeds. The images are of varying sizes and aspect ratios, and are split into training and testing sets.
Model Architecture
The model is based on a custom convolutional neural network architecture built on top of a pre-trained mobilenet V2 network. The pre-trained network is used as a feature extractor, and the custom network is trained on top of these features to perform the classification task. The custom network consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by max pooling layers and fully connected layers. Dropout is used to prevent overfitting, and the final output layer consists of 120 nodes representing the 120 different dog breeds.
Training
The model is trained using the Keras deep learning framework with the TensorFlow backend. The model is trained on a GPU for faster training, and data augmentation techniques are used to increase the size of the training set and improve generalization. The model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function, and the Adam optimizer is used for optimization. The training process is monitored using metrics such as accuracy and loss, and early stopping is used to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The confusion matrix is also computed to visualize the distribution of predictions across the different dog breeds. The model is also evaluated on a set of real-world dog images to test its generalization ability.
Usage
To use the model, simply input an image of a dog and the model will output a probability distribution over the 120 different dog breeds. The breed with the highest probability is the predicted breed of the input dog image. The model can be used for a wide range of applications such as dog breed identification in animal shelters, veterinary clinics, and dog shows.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning with a custom convolutional neural network for the task of dog breed identification. The model achieves high accuracy and generalization ability, and can be used for a variety of real-world applications. The code for this project can be found in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.
